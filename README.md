- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Patrick
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building responsive fullstack applications and websites.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bunch of stuff. Everyday, I practice something related to programming it could be javascript, node.js, python, django, or DS and algorithms. It's a marathon not a sprint, I find technology fascinating, and I love to learn.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building sustainable business solutions. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I can be reached by email at pwmcclung@aol.com. Why not reach out to me if you have an idea or need a software engineer. I am currently pursuing full time software engineering opportunities.
