- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Patrick
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Artificial Intelligece and Cyber Security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bunch of stuff. Everyday, I practice something related to programming it could be javascript, node.js, python, django, or DS and algorithms. It's a marathon not a sprint, I find technology fascinating, and I love to learn.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building sustainable business solutions.
- Currently working through HackTheBox Academy's Penetration Tester curriculum and looking for full time remote work.
