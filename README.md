- 👋 Hi, I’m @pwmcclung
- 👀 I’m interested in building responsive fullstack websites and applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bunch. Everyday, I practice javascript, node.js, python, django, DS and algorithms. It's a marathon not a sprint and I love to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building sustainable business solutions that can level the playing field between big businesses and small  buisnesses. Big companies hold way too much control over their markets and I think technology can help change that.
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be reached by email at pwmcclung@aol.com. I've had that email for 22 years and it's probably the best way to reach me.
