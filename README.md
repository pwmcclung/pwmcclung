- 👋 Hi, I’m @pwmcclung
- 👀 I’m interested in building responsive fullstack websites and applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bunch of stuff. Everyday, I practice something related to programming it could be javascript, node.js, python, django, or DS and algorithms. It's a marathon not a sprint, I find technology fascinating, and I love to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building sustainable business solutions that can level the playing field between big businesses and small  buisnesses. In my opinion,  big companies hold way too much control over their markets and I think technology can help change that.
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be reached by email at pwmcclung@aol.com. Why not reach out to me if you have an idea or need a software engineer. I am currently pursuing full time software engineering opportunities.
