- 👋 Hi, I’m Patrick
- 👀 I’m interested in building responsive fullstack applications and websites.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bunch of stuff. Everyday, I practice something related to programming it could be javascript, node.js, python, django, or DS and algorithms. It's a marathon not a sprint, I find technology fascinating, and I love to learn.
- I’m looking to collaborate on building sustainable business solutions.
- I am currently studying cyber security and artificial intelligence.
- Working through HackTheBox Academy's Penetration Tester curriculum and looking for work.
